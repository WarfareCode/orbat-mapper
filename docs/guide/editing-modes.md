# Editing modes

ORBAT Mapper tries to be the "Swiss Army knife" for building ORBATs and scenarios and therefore has different ways you
can edit a scenario. You will typically switch between the different editing modes depending on your current tasks or
preferences.

### Map mode

The map edit mode focuses on unit locations.

### Grid mode

The grid edit mode is heavily inspired by spreadsheets and offers a quick and efficient way of editing units.

### Chart mode

The chart edit mode if for those who prefer to visualize their ORBATs graphically.

::: info
Grid and chart editing modes currently have limited functionality. They are still in development
and will be improved in future releases.
