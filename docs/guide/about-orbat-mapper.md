# About ORBAT Mapper

ORBAT Mapper is a web-based application for building order of battles (ORBATs) and plotting unit locations on a map.
With ORBAT Mapper you can recreate historic battles and military scenarios right in your browser.

ORBAT Mapper is created by a hobbyist. Check out the [tools section](../resources/tools.md) if you need something
more professional.
