# About ORBAT Mapper

ORBAT Mapper is a web application that lets you build order of battles (ORBATs) and plot unit locations
on a map. With ORBAT Mapper you can recreate historic battles and military scenarios in your browser.

A special feature of ORBAT Mapper is that it adds a time dimension to your ORBATs. This allows you to
create animated maps that show the movement of units over time.

ORBAT Mapper is created by a hobbyist, and is not intended to be a C2IS, simulation or military planning tool.
Check out the [tools section](../resources/tools.md) if you need something more professional.
