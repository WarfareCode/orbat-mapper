# Military history

There is a staggering amount of military history content available online. Here are some resources I find interesting
and useful.

## Websites

If you are interested in WW2 history I highly recommend the
site [Project'44 the road to liberation](https://www.project44.ca/). Their [interactive
WWII web maps](https://map.project44.ca/) and [story maps](https://map.project44.ca/story-maps) are fantastic!

Another fascinating site is Dr. Leo
Niehorster's [World War II Armed Forces â€” Orders of Battle and Organizations](http://niehorster.org/). The site
is a gold mine of information.

[HyperWar, A hypertext history of the second world war](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/) contains a vast
collection of documents, maps, photographs, and other materials related to the war. Users can browse the resources by
country, theater of war, or service branch.

[U-boat Archive](https://www.uboatarchive.net/) is a fantastic resource for those interested in submarine warfare during
WW2.
The site contains a wealth of information, including U-boat war diaries with accompanying KMZ files, charts and
photographs.

Do you want to know more about the battleship Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine? Then check
out [KBismarck.com](https://www.kbismarck.com/).

For those who are interested in Cold War history, Hans Boersma's
site [Netherlands Armed Forces ORDER OF BATTLE 1985](https://www.orbat85.nl/) is a
real treat. The site provides information on the orders of battle, equipment, and organization of NATO and Warsaw Pact
armed forces during the Cold War

[Naval-History.net](https://www.naval-history.net/index.htm) contains a wealth of information about the history of the
Royal Navy. The site also contains an online
version of Gordon Smith's
book [BATTLE ATLAS of the FALKLANDS WAR 1982 by Land, Sea and Air](https://www.naval-history.net/NAVAL1982FALKLANDS.htm).
This book is used as one of
the sources for ORBAT mapper's main demo scenario.

The [Battle Order](https://www.battleorder.org/) website contains a wealth of in-depth content about ORBATs, TO&Es,
tactics, logistics and more.
