# Tutorial introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of recreating
the [Battle of Goose Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Goose_Green), the first major land battle
of the [Falklands War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War). The battle is a good fit for a beginners tutorial because it is extensively documented and involves a relatively small
number of units.
