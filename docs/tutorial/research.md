# Research

The initial step in creating a historical scenario typically involves extensive research. Understanding the involved
units, their activities, the timing, and the location is crucial. You want to know as many details as possible
because you have to map the movement of units over time. If you are aiming for accuracy and details, it can
be surprisingly hard to find detailed enough information. Usually you have to consult a wide range of books, documents
and websites.
